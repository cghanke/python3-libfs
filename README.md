libfs
======

A virtual filesystem based on pyfuse3.
It presents a collection of files in a virtual directory structure based by the
of the files metadata (Simple Key-Value pairs).
Each directory-level represents a key and all directories in it are
different values for this key, respecting the key/values pairs of the higher directories.

This is best explained by an example: mp3
Here, the  files are sorted by their id3-tags.
So you could sort them by

Genre/Album/Year/Artist/Album/file.mp3

or by

Artist/Album/file.mp3

The filename itself is also generated by a user-defined pattern.  
You can access the metadata by '%{KEY}'  
In the id3-case the default filename is:  
"%{tracknumber} -- %{title}.mp3"  

The type of metadata supported is implemented by plugins, thus it is  
easy to extend.

Another plugin could be the exif, which reads the metadata of  
jpeg files.

You can also change the metadata of files by moving it to another location  
within libfs. For this, it is allowed to create new directories within a mounted libfs.
These will be lost when they are still empty and the libfs unmounted.
